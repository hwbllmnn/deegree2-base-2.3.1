 * <p>
 * The transformation parameters could only be derived empirically by a set of points common to both coordinate
 * reference systems it means by identical points. Choice, allocation, number and the quality of coordinates of the
 * points affect extensive the results and the accuracy. Therefore different realizations for transformations from one
 * datum to another exist.
